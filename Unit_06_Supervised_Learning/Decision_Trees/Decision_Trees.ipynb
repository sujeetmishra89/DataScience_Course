    "# What (is it?):\n",
    "\n",
    "- A decision tree is a flowchart that helps determine a course of action or show a statistical probability\n",
    "- A decision tree learns a sequence of if then questions with each question involving one feature and one split point.\n",
    "- Anatomy of decision trees (depth of a tree, root nodes, decision nodes, leaf nodes/terminal nodes)\n",
    "- Start at the root node, and traverse the tree until you reach a leaf (terminal) node.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why (to use?):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be used for both regression and classification.\n",
    "- Easy to interpret, simple model.\n",
    "- The tree can be visualized and hence, for non-technical users, it is easier to explain model implementation\n",
    "- Don’t require feature scaling.\n",
    "- Don’t have to standardize data unlike PCA and logistic regression which are sensitive to effects of not standardizing data.\n",
    "- Allow you to calculate feature importance\n",
    "\n",
    "# When/Where (to use?):\n",
    "\n",
    "- For data exploration to understand the data relationship in a tree hierarchy structure.\n",
    "- When handling non-linear data sets effectively.\n",
    "- When entire dataset and features can be used\n",
    "- When we have limited computational power\n",
    "- When we are not worried about accuracy on future datasets.\n",
    "- When the data is more non-parametric in nature\n",
    "\n",
    "# How (to use?):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Popular algorithms are ID3, C4.5, C5.0, CART, CHAID, MARSplines.\n",
    "- Scikit-learn uses an optimized version of the CART algorithm.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Prone to overfitting"
