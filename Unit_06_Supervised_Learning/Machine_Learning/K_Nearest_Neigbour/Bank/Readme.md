# Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm 

## Dataset

The dataset is provided by a bank with variable descriptions as mentioned below. 

- ID: Customer ID,

- Age: Customer Age,

- Experience: #years of Professional experience,

- Income: Annual Income of the customer in $000,

- ZIP Code:Home address Zip Code,

- Family: Family size of the customer,

- CCAvg: Avg spending on credit cards per month in $000,

- Education: Education level 1:Undergrad 2: Graduate 3:Advanced/Professional ,

- Mortgage: Value of mortgage if any $000,

- Securities Account: Does the customer have a securities account with the bank?,

- CD Account:Does the customer have a certificate of deposit account with the bank?,

- Online : Does the customer use internet banking facilities?,

- CreditCard: Does the customer use a credit card issued by the respective bank?,

- Personal Loan : Did the customer default on the loan or not ?
 
 ## Project_1
 By using the bank data set we predict the income of the customer based on other independent variables .We estimate the income using KNN 
 regression approach provided by **FNN library** in R.We check for accuracy of our predictions for various k-values(1,3,5,7) and select   the K which gives us the lowest Mean Average Percentage error.
 
 ## Project_2
  The objective of the project is to build a classification model using Knn algorithm to predict whether the customer is going to       default on loan or not. I built the models using sklearn in Python and also libraries in R.The implentations are in R and Python as shown using the default distance measures.
  
 ## Project_3
  Project_3 is based on Project_2 but instead of using the default distance measures such as euclidean distances,i implemented **value difference measure** as a measure of distance for categorical variables in Python.Value Difference Metric (VDM) is one of the widely used distance metrics for nominal attributes.
