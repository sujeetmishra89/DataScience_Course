    "When we go grocery shopping, we often have a standard list of things to buy. Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on oneâ€™s needs and preferences. A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.\n",
    "2. Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.\n",
    "3. Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.\n",
    "4. X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we may know that certain items are frequently bought together, the question is, how do we uncover these associations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides increasing sales profits, association rules can also be used in other fields. In medical diagnosis for instance, understanding which symptoms tend to co-morbid can help to improve patient care and medicine prescription."
