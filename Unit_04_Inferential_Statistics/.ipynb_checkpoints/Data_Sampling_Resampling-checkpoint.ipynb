    "## 1. Statistical Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition :\n",
    "\n",
    "Data sampling refers to statistical methods for selecting observations from the domain with the objective of estimating a population parameter. It is an active process of gathering observations with the intent of estimating a population variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical sampling is the process of selecting subsets of examples from a population with the objective of estimating properties of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling is an active process. There is a goal of estimating population properties and control over how the sampling is to occur. This control falls short of influencing the process that generates each observation, such as performing an experiment. As such, sampling as a field sits neatly between pure uncontrolled observation and controlled experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling is usually distinguished from the closely related field of experimental design, in that in experiments one deliberately perturbs some part of the population in order to see what the effect of that action is. Sampling is also usually distinguished from observational studies, in which one has little or no control over how the observations on the population were obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept :\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of data represents an observation about something in the world. When working with data, we often do not have access to all possible observations. This could be for many reasons; for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It may difficult or expensive to make more observations.\n",
    "2. It may be challenging to gather all observations together.\n",
    "3. More observations are expected to be made in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations made in a domain represent samples of some broader idealized and unknown population of all possible observations that could be made in the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a useful conceptualization as we can see the separation and relationship between observations and the idealized population.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also see that, even if we intend to use big data infrastructure on all available data, that the data still represents a sample of observations from an idealized population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we may wish to estimate properties of the population. We do this by using samples of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling consists of selecting some part of the population to observe so that one may estimate something about the whole population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits : \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many benefits to sampling compared to working with fuller or complete datasets, including reduced cost and greater speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Sample :\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perform sampling, it requires that you carefully define your population and the method by which you will select (and possibly reject) observations to be a part of your data sample. This may very well be defined by the population parameters that you wish to estimate using the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some aspects to consider prior to collecting a data sample include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample Goal. The population property that you wish to estimate using the sample.\n",
    "2. Population. The scope or domain from which observations could theoretically be made.\n",
    "3. Selection Criteria. The methodology that will be used to accept or reject observations in your sample.\n",
    "4. Sample Size. The number of observations that will constitute the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some obvious questions are how best to obtain the sample and make the observations and, once the sample data are in hand, how best to use them to estimate the characteristics of the whole population. Obtaining the observations involves questions of sample size, how to select the sample, what observational methods to use, and what measurements to record.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simple Random Sampling: Samples are drawn with a uniform probability from the domain.\n",
    "2. Systematic Sampling: Samples are drawn using a pre-specified pattern, such as at intervals.\n",
    "3. Stratified Sampling: Samples are drawn within pre-specified categories (i.e. strata).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these are the more common types of sampling that you may encounter, there are other techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sampling Errors :\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling requires that we make a statistical inference about the population from a small set of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize properties from the sample to the population. This process of estimation and generalization is much faster than working with all possible observations, but will contain errors. In many cases, we can quantify the uncertainty of our estimates and add errors bars, such as confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to introduce errors into your data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main types of errors include selection bias and sampling error.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Selection Bias. Caused when the method of drawing observations skews the sample in some way.\n",
    "2. Sampling Error. Caused due to the random nature of drawing observations skewing the sample in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other types of errors may be present, such as systematic errors in the way observations or measurements are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases and more, the statistical properties of the sample may be different from what would be expected in the idealized population, which in turn may impact the properties of the population that are being estimated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple methods, such as reviewing raw observations, summary statistics, and visualizations can help expose simple errors, such as measurement corruption and the over- or underrepresentation of a class of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, care must be taken both when sampling and when drawing conclusions about the population while sampling."

    "## 2. Statistical Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resampling is a methodology of economically using a a collected dataset (data sample) to improve the estimate/accuracy and quantify the uncertainty of a population parameter. Resampling methods make use of a nested resampling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a data sample, it can be used to estimate the population parameter. The problem is that we only have a single estimate of the population parameter, with little idea of the variability or uncertainty in the estimate. One way to address this is by estimating the population parameter multiple times from our data sample. This is called resampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical resampling methods are procedures that describe how to economically use available data to estimate a population parameter. The result can be both a more accurate estimate of the parameter (such as taking the mean of the estimates) and a quantification of the uncertainty of the estimate (such as adding a confidence interval).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept :\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to resample form the original data — either directly or via a fitted model — to create replicate datasets, from which the variability of the quantiles of interest can be assessed without long-winded and error-prone analytical calculation. Because this approach involves repeating the original data analysis procedure with many replicate sets of data, these are sometimes called computer-intensive methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each new subsample from the original data sample is used to estimate the population parameter. The sample of estimated population parameters can then be considered with statistical tools in order to quantify the expected value and variance, providing measures of the uncertainty of the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical sampling methods can be used in the selection of a subsample from the original sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key difference is that process must be repeated multiple times. The problem with this is that there will be some relationship between the samples as observations that will be shared across multiple subsamples. This means that the subsamples and the estimated population parameters are not strictly identical and independently distributed. This has implications for statistical tests performed on the sample of estimated population parameters downstream, i.e. paired statistical tests may be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, resampling techniques for estimating model performance operate similarly: a subset of samples are used to fit a model and the remaining samples are used to estimate the efficacy of the model. This process is repeated multiple times and the results are aggregated and summarized. The differences in techniques usually center around the method in which subsamples are chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resampling methods :\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. k-fold Cross-Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "A dataset is partitioned into k groups, where each group is given the opportunity of being used as a held out test set leaving the remaining groups as the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the k-fold cross-validation method to estimate the skill of predictive models on small samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-fold cross-validation method specifically lends itself to use in the evaluation of predictive models that are repeatedly trained on one subset of the data and evaluated on a second held-out subset of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Bootstrap Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the bootstrap method to estimate population variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Samples are drawn from the dataset with replacement (allowing the same sample to appear more than once in the sample), where those instances not drawn into the data sample may be used for the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap method can be used for the same purpose, but is a more general and simpler method intended for estimating a population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros :\n",
    "1. Resampling methods are very easy to use, requiring little mathematical knowledge.\n",
    "2. They are methods that are easy to understand and implement compared to specialized statistical methods that may require deep technical skill in order to select and interpret.\n",
    "3. The resampling methods are easy to learn and easy to apply. They require no mathematics beyond introductory high-school algebra, et are applicable in an exceptionally broad range of subject areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons :\n",
    "1. A downside of the methods is that they can be computationally very expensive, requiring tens, hundreds, or even thousands of resamples in order to develop a robust estimate of the population parameter."
